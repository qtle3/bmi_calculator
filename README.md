# BMI Calculator

## Overview

This Python program calculates and evaluates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person based on their weight and height. The BMI is calculated using a mathematical formula, and the program determines if the BMI is within a healthy range, below, or above it.

## How It Works

### Functions

1. **bmi_calculator(w, h):**
   - Takes weight (w) in pounds and height (h) in inches as inputs.
   - Returns the calculated BMI.

2. **BMI():**
   - Prompts the user to enter their weight and height.
   - Calculates the BMI using the `bmi_calculator` function.
   - Prints the calculated BMI, rounded to two decimal places.
   - Determines if the BMI is within a healthy range, below, or above it, and prints the corresponding message.

### Key Concepts Covered

- **Functions:** How to define and use functions to organize code.
- **User Input:** Collecting user input using the `input()` function.
- **Type Conversion:** Converting user inputs to `float` for arithmetic operations.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Calculating BMI using a mathematical formula.
- **Conditional Statements:** Using `if-elif-else` statements to evaluate the BMI range.
- **String Formatting:** Rounding and formatting the BMI value for output.
